## About
This repo includes a variety of bash scripts from various learning materials you can run on your computer to help automate
some manual tasks.


### Configure Your Login Script
Simplifying the way to call the scripts is important. As such it is advised you configure your PATH variable so that these
scripts are automatically callable.  One way of doing this is through the following:
- create a directory in your home directory e.g */home/<yourusername>/workdirectory*
- navigate to */home/<yourusername>* and find your login script file (some distributions, have it as .login, .bashrc or .profile)
- add *export PATH="/home/<yourusername>/directory/:$PATH"* to the end of the file

### Running the Scripts
- clone this repository
- extract the files to your /home/<yourusername>/workdirectory directory
